##Week 2: Existing Open Source Summaries

For this assignment, I decided to look into a few open source projects in order to explore potential projects that I might want to contribute to as well as to familizarize myself with the online open source environment.  I began my search with a few simple Google searches; however, I found that I had the most success browsing different projects once I stumbled upon the Trending Repositories page on GitHub.  After reading up on a few of these applications, I decided to conduct my in depth analysis on three projects: AngularJS, Docker, and Bootstrap.

###AngularJS

AngularJS is an open source software that is intended to assist users in developing client-side products by extending HTML. 
It is meant to provide developers with the necessary tools to construct the proper framework for their application by making HTML a much more valuable resource.  

The source code is all available through a GitHub repository with over 800 total contributors.  From the time that I am writing this summary, the latest commit came in roughly two hours ago, clearly indicating the continued committment by the developers to improve this product.  In addition to the frequent activity on GitHub, the home site for AngularJS showcases just how interested developers are in this software.  Numerous videos have been posted in which the developers talk about the actual code behind their product.  Furthermore, the home page includes a brief tutorial meant to help newcomers get started with the software if they are interested in it.  From the screenshots and phrasing, it is clear that these intructions are meant for a developer audience.  

AngularJS appears to have a solid user base, too.  Their site contains a detailed "Learn" section in which users are provided with the necessary resources to get started working with the software.  This includes a detailed tutorial for installation and initial setup, as well as a link to their YouTube channel that has numerous useful videos for new and experienced users.  

I also found it interesting that the site includes links to their blog, a chat room, and other social media sites that users can use to communicate with one another and further pursue their interest if they desire to do so.  I found that this was one of the strongest features that AngularJS had to offer in terms of fueling user interest.  

Their code is very well documented and remains fairly consistent throughout.  I am intersted in looking more into documentation potentially, since I really have not had the chance to focus specifically on that; however, I'm not really sure where to begin for a project such as that.  If I were going to look at documentation, it would not be for this project.  AngularJS has a whole development section that looks clean, useful, and accurate in declaring documentation.

If I were to contribute to this project in some way, it would likely be through development.  I would have to do a bit more exploring in order to see if there would be a specific improvement I could work on myself; however, I feel as though I would be able to contribute more effectively by modifying existing source code.  This could be anything from simple clean up to perhaps utilizing another library or API.  Fortunately, AngularJS provides developers with a great place to start.  Their site hosts a "Contribute" page in which users are instructed on how to properly install and test the project.  From a quick look at this, I can gather that they might be lacking in the testing department, which is something that I do not have a ton of experience with, but am open to looking into for this project.
